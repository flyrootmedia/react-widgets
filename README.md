## Responsive React Widgets for Your Projects

**NOTE:** This is very much a WIP right now. I'm just getting started on it, but the end goal is to have a collection of re-usable, self-contained widgets with a default theme that can be added to any React project which uses Redux. These are certainly nothing revolutionary or particularly unique, but they will be components I find myself using regularly, and hopefully someone will find them useful.
